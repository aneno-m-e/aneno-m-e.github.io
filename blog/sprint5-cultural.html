    <p>My dear marine critters,</p>
    <p>
      This is will be my blog's last entry before entering Bootcamp. During this 10 weeks journey through Foundations, I met again with HTML and CSS and starting to get to know Javascript. I also reflected on myself, my learning skills and my ability to communicate with others.      
    </p>
   <p>
     In the end, the most surprising aspect of the Core Curriculum was how well it echoed the personal path I was already on. It gave me a chance to finally take the time to organise my thoughts about my values and put them down in writing. The Core curriculum also brought meditation back in my life and is now pushing me to take on journaling. I am grateful that this part of my dev journey aligned with my personal path and that it helped me to finally bring in my life practices I've read a lot about in the past.
   </p>
   <p>
     It might seem strange to see how important a place the core curriculum occupies in this course. But code writing is just a part of being a web developer. Other facets includes working as a team, problem-solve, continuous learning. Knowing yourself, trusting your ability to learn and developing your emotion intelligence will help you when facing challenges.
