    <h3>Dear marine critters,</h3>
    <p>
      Those last weeks, I've learned a lot about how to solve problems using humain techniques (they don't have tentacles to help them after all). I've also been through a few Javascript katas to put to use this new language I learnt last week.
    </p>
    <h2>How I solved a simple problem</h2>
    <p>During one of the katas, I worked on creating a simple gradebook for a few students. The goal was to be able to easily add new notes and get an    average for each students. I knew what to do but the code I used to add new scores wasn't working. I looked for a solution without luck, trying something different, digging in the aethernet, ... Nothing. Until the answer came to me in the most unexpected way (like a certain ring to a certain hobbit): in the middle of the night. I had a few sleeps last week when I would wake up in the middle of the night and, in that half-sleep state, my brain would be processing lines of javascript after lines of javascript. It's during one of those phases that the solution came to me: I needed to use brackets instead of dots! (which is what the curriculum warned us about at the very beginning of the katas, did I realise on the next morning). Luckily, I retained the solution in my mind throughout my sleep and was able to apply it with success the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I really enjoyed solving those katas. It was really stimulating to run into problems and build different ways to approach them.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem solving techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the different katas, I used a large array of techniques, it is now time to reflect on them.
      <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode</li>
        <p>I used this technique several times, to step back and look at my problem from a general point of view before breaking it down into smaller steps.      I noticed tho that I tended to use it at the start of my work but wasn't reviewing it as I went through the problem and had to take different steps    that the ones planned at the beginning. I want to improve on that.
        </p>
        <li>Trying something</li>
        <p>
          All the time!
        </p>
        <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
        <p>
          Not so much this time around but I use it a lot at work so I'll make use of it soon enough.
        </p>
        <li>Reading error messages</li>
        <p>
          Great to find where the errors are located! Once I'm more familiar with the error messages, they will alo bring a valuable input.
        </p>
        <li>Console.logging</li>
        <p>
          A. Lot. It was my best friend to understand what my functions were doing to my data and which parts weren't working as planned.
        </p>
        <li>Googling</li>
        <p>
          once again, a lot. Especially to find methods that I hadn't encountered before and understand how they worked.
        </p>
        <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
        <p>
          I didn't use that technique but I'm eager to see the 5 weeks cohort catching up so we can takle problems together.
        </p>
        <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
        <p>
          When I was still stucked after using the previous techniques.
        </p>
        <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
        <p>
          I tried to be aware of the way I solved problems. I also commented my code, to add explanations and remind myself to review solutions that I felt I didn't grasped fully.
        </p>        
      </ul>
    </p>
