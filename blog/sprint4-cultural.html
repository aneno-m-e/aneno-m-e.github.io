    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is the brain ability to build new neural paths at any moment in life. The structure of our brain is not set definitely during our early years, it can reorganise itself. Knowing that is important, as it gives us confidence in our ability to learn, change, grow and become a better person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning being one of my core values, I've always been eager to get out of my comfort zone, which probably benefited my brain's plasticity. Reading about this subject today, I'm even more resolved to strengthen my meditation skilss and exercise regularly. I've found <a href="http://secondwindmovement.com/neuroplasticity/">this article</a> and <a href="http://siimland.com/how-to-increase-neuroplasticity/">that one</a> had approaches I could relate to.  
    </p>
    <h1>Growth mindset</h1>
    <p>
      Growth mindset is the one's ability to know they can change and improve, to be aware of their brain's plasticity. It is opposed to fixed mindset. Researching on mindsets led me to learn about benefit mindset which, in complement to growth mindset, is something I'd like to integrate more in my life.
