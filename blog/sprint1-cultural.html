    <h1>My core values</h1>
        <p>I'll start this dive in my innerself by a quote: "The forms that differentiate beings don’t matter much if their thoughts unite to build a universe". It's taken from one of my favorite BD (franco-belgian comic) when I was growing up: Yoko Tsuno. Three years ago, I stayed for a few weeks at my Dad's place and read the whole serie again. It was eye-opening: I realised how influencial it had been in the forming of my core values and it was quite uncanny. That being said, Yoko has some damn good values and I'm proud to have taken on some of them.</p>

        <h2>Openness & Open-mindedness</h2>
        <p><span class="value">Openness</span> is one of my core values operating in the background. It has grown a lot since I've started travelling and got out of my comfort zone. But I've always been curious of everything, always thrived to discover new things. I love going on <span class="value">adventures</span>, I embrace new experiences and value diversity. This has helped me being more self-aware (this and knidding brioche. Knidding is the best for self-reflection.).</p>
        <p><span class="value">Open-mindedness</span> is one of my intrinsic traits. I'm very thankful for that value and believe that it is not foreign to the strong liking for <span class="value">weirdness</span> I've developed over the years. I find a lot of satisfaction in challenging myself and working toward understanding different (sometimes alien) viewpoints until I <span class="value">change</span> and accept (or adopt) them.</p>    
        <p>Open-mindedness has been at the core of ethical decisions I took on a regular basis while I was working as a receptionist of a boarding house. When I started, the only people who would get a room were the ones who were mostly conforming to the norm, which I found unfair. I quietly challenge this by signing in people who didn't fit into the previous standard, as long as they seemed able to follow rules and pay their rent. This led to more diversity in our tenants and I hope helped creating links between different circles and social categories.</p>
        <h2>Balance</h2>
        <p>The value holding the most central place to me is <span class="value">balance</span>. It's the probably the one weighing the most in my decisions, the one that comes most often at the front of my mind, whereas the others operate more in the background. And I'm not talking about work/life balance. For me, thriving for balance is a way to achieve <span class="value">harmony</span> (yes, I don't deal well with conflicts). Everything is connected, every actions have consequences, and if everybody could demonstrate more <span class="value">temperance</span> and <span class="value">cooperation</span>, I believe the world would be a better place. The exciting thing with this ideal is that balance is always tipping to one side or another as conditions are changing, so there are always new challenges to face to reach a (temporary) equilibrium.</p>
        <h2>Knowledge and Learning</h2>
        <p>Those values used to be my pillars. As soon as I learned how to read, I used to spend my days reading (and I still read a lot). I love <span class="value">learning</span> new things. Actually, to be perfectly honest, I need it. I also treasure <span class="value">knowledge</span>, sometime up to an unhealthy point. When I was younger, I would be more moved by the loss of heritage and knowledge than by the loss of lives. I remember crying at the sight of Zeugma being submerged. Later on, I got upset at the idea of all the traditional crafts being lost and thought it should be my duty to go around the world to rescue them.</p>
        <h2>Calm</h2>
        <p>Throughout my life, I've always been a <span class="value">calm</span> person, very patient. I exert patience with others but also with life: "Good things come to those who wait", without being idle, working to harvest the fruits of my labor once they're ripe. Being calm also allows me to approched others with <span class="value">empathy</span> and kindness.</p>
        <p>More recently, I have developped new values:</p>
        <h2>Agency</h2>
        <p>This has been triggered by my first year in New Zealand, where for the first time of my life, I was really <span class="value">independant</span> and relied mostly on myself. Before that, I never had or felt the need to decide where my life was going. I had it easy at school (I would actually describe studying as my comfort zone), and after graduating, I was staying at my parents' place between jobs. At that time, I was feeling that I was lacking purpose in my life and deciding to come to New Zealand was the first step toward gaining agency. And after eight months of work and travels, I became conscious of how rewarding it was to be <span class="value">self-reliant</span>.</p>
        <h2>Discipline and Commitment</h2>
        <p>Those values are still new to me. As I mentioned before, I never really faced difficulty at school and made my way through uni relatively easily. Also, after giving up on my dreams of becoming an egyptologist, I never really took time to formlate a new life project. In the recent years, I put more thoughts into it, reflecting on what was important to me and where I wanted to go and I'm slowing learning how to stay focused and persistant, instead of changing my mind.</p>
