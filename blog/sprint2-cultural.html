    <h1>Learning plan</h1>
    <h3>Intention:</h3>
    <h2>Develop a career based on remote work, and focused on projects matching my values.</h2>
    <p>
      To achieve my career and study goals, I can rely in my problem solving skills, especially computational thinking. I am usually able to overcome obstacles thanks to my love of learning and my ability to think out of the bitten path. I am also self-organised and flexible and do well in teams. However, as I am an introvert, always being surrounded by people can be exhausting. Another limitation I can face is second-guessing myself when I'm not 100% sure of what I'm doing. I also tend to take critics personnally.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I'm at EDA, I'd like to get better a receiving critics/feedback. I also want to be more confident, assertive when talking about my technical skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      My plan for the foundations is to do as much as I can, as soon as I can, so if I encountered obstacles or if life gets in the way, I have a safety buffer For the bootcamp, I think my focus will be more to go with the flow and focus on the essentials so I don't get lost into details. I hope that the flipped classroom model will help foster positive team work habits and relationships between students and with the facilitator. I'm looking forward working collaboratively, supporting others when they need it and being supported when I need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When facing a technical difficulties, I'll first go through the EDA framework detailed during Sprint 1. I'm expecting to be able to solve a lot of problems using the rubber duck technique. If I can't overcome the obstacle by myself in a raisonable amount of time, I'll turn to my cohort and ultimately to the facilitators. When facing personal problems, I'll first turn to my familly and friends for support. Depending on the context, I might also ask for help at EDA, but whatever it is, I'll make sure to let my cohort and the facilitators know that something is going on and how it might impaired my work or the way I engage with them. I'm expecting the facilitation team to let me the freedom to make my own way through the curriculum while making sure I'm staying on tracks. I also expect them to be there if I ask for support.
    </p>

    <h2>During Bootcamp</h2>
    <p>
      My long term goal is to be able to work remotely so I have the freedom the live the life I want. This involves travels but more than being a digital nomad, I want to have time to grow a garden, work on DIY projects, continue studying, contribute to the community, ...<br>
      My ideal career path would see me working on projects matching my values or based on values I support. I would love to see my work support social enterprises, give back to the community, help create a more creative and fair world. And on my way, I may inadvertantly become a team leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a little bit difficult right now to picture what skills I will end up with at the end of the bootcamp. It's actually slightly scary to think about it. But one thing is sure, even if I don't quickly get my foot in the door of the IT industry, I want to get involved in projects, online or during hackathons so I can apply what I learned. I also want to bring people together to help me realise one of my project: a collaborative map of products and services in Aotearoa engaging with environemental and social challenges, community education, developing a locally based economy, offering seasonal, handcrafted and fair trade produces, ...
    </p>
    <p>
      During bootcamp, my biggest strengths will be my love for problem-solving, my empathy and listening skills and my ability to think outside of the box. When starting Foundations, I was a bit worried that I might not enjoy problem-solving as much as I thought I would and that I would be really get to "think". But those 10 weeks showed me I was wrong. I enjoyed being challenged and having to focus and push my brain. I also surprised myself adopting habits and strategies and realising they were part of the "Think like a developer" part of the course.<br>
      One the other hand, I will have to be careful not to get lost into details and not to try tackling too many things at the same time or I could get discouraged and doubt myself, as I've experienced during Foundations when I tried to get ahead of the curriculum at all costs. I'm counting on the Bootcamp to provide me with feedback on where I'm really at and what I need to improve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest non-technical challenge I'm expecting to face is finding my place in the cohort. I usually take some time before I find my place in a group, and I'm wondering how it will work with bootcamp requiring us to get to work together from the start and to find our marks very quickly. As the curriculum worked for me so far, I am more curious to see how it will work out rather than worried and I trust that the EDA team will facilitate the process. This will be an opportunity for me to improve my ability to connect with people in a short amount of time. But once I once I'll reach my comfort zone, I'd like to work on developing some leadership skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bootcamp will be an intense 9 weeks. I want to be focused and trust the "learn in time" motto so I won't be squished under the workload. I'm hoping that I'll be able to disconnect during lunch breack, but to stay on campus after class to work with the rest of the cohort. Self-checks and weekly Tech-ins will provide an opportunity to reflect and raise problems on time before they have a negative impact.
