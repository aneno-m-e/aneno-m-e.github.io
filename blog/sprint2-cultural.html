    <h1>Learning plan</h1>
    <h2>Intention</h2>
    <h4>Develop a career based on remote work, and focused on projects matching my values.</h4>
    <p>To achieve my career and study goals, I can rely in my problem solving skills, especially computational thinking. I am usually able to overcome obstacles thanks to my love of learning and my ability to think out of the bitten path. I am also self-organised and flexible and do well in teams. However, as I am an introvert, always being surrounded by people can be exhausting. Another limitation I can face is second-guessing myself when I'm not 100% sure of what I'm doing. I also tend to take critics personnally.</p>
    <p>While I'm at EDA, I'd like to get better a receiving critics/feedback. I also want to be more confident, assertive when talking about my technical skills.</p>
    <p>My plan for the foundations is to do as much as I can, as soon as I can, so if I encountered obstacles or if life gets in the way, I have a safety buffer For the bootcamp, I think my focus will be more to go with the flow and focus on the essentials so I don't get lost into details. I hope that the flipped classroom model will help foster positive team work habits and relationships between students and with the facilitator. I'm looking forward working collaboratively, supporting others when they need it and being supported when I need it.</p>
    <p>When facing a technical difficulties, I'll first go through the EDA framework detailed during Sprint 1. I'm expecting to be able to solve a lot of problems using the rubber duck technique. If I can't overcome the obstacle by myself in a raisonable amount of time, I'll turn to my cohort and ultimately to the facilitators. When facing personal problems, I'll first turn to my familly and friends for support. Depending on the context, I might also ask for help at EDA, but whatever it is, I'll make sure to let my cohort and the facilitators know that something is going on and how it might impaired my work or the way I engage with them. I'm expecting the facilitation team to let me the freedom to make my own way through the curriculum while making sure I'm staying on tracks. I also expect them to be there if I ask for support.</p>
